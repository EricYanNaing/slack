## Getting Started

1. Clone the project from here 'https://github.com/EricYanNaing/slack'
2. copy the codes from ".env.local.examples" to ".env.local"
3. npm install
4. for supabase setup, I didn't use template from supabase but I did create by myself. You can integrate the SQL quries from supabase folder. You can see how to integrate the files here 'https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development#database-migrations'.
5. you can integrate tables by using the files from 'csv_files_for_tables' folder.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
